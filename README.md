# Ai-Classifications-PartA
Common classification algorithms on the Iris and digits dataset. These algorithms are supervised learning algorithms which are the decision tree classification algorithm, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, and the backpropogation algorithm. This code developed is for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence @ Mississippi State Fall 22
